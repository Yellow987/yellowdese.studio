Thank you so much for downloading the updated version of my TDA Hatsune Miku base!
This was only meant to be a small update (fixing small rigging problems, textures, etc.) but it ended up being a whole makeover!
Either way, please follow the rules of this model. I haven't had to take anything down so far, so I hope this model isn't the first...

Thank you!
